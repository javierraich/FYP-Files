Final Year Project files

Some debugging scripts, scripts that have been replaced, and very simple scripts have not been included.

Each of the folders contains a README file explaining the different scripts of each.

Overview:
FileWriting - Modify files and file names for easier loading into datastore objects and quicker training
GPUCoderTests - Deploy networks as CUDA code for testing timing and error.
LoadImageDatastore - Load datastore objects used to train networks (both 2 RGB and RGB and optical flow)
NetworksBuildTrain - Build the structure of each network and train it
OpticalFlowVisualization - Some simple scripts used to visualize optical flow.
PWCNETFlownet2 - Scripts that modify original Github implementations to loop over a set of image pairs, also write output flows as .mat files.
